                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Odessa, Texas.  I moved to Kansas City with my parents
                    after I graduated from high school.  I have two sisters and a brother who all 
                    still live in Texas.  Most of my friends and my two sisters now live in the Dallas
                    area so I generally visit there at least once a year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I am married and my wife grew up in Blue Springs.  We have one son and he is 
                    4 years old.  I spend most of my "free" time playing with toys, watching kid shows
                    or playing at the park.  When I get the chance, I enjoy mountain biking or going
                    for a hike.
                </p>
